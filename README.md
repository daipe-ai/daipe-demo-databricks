# Daipe Framework project template

This is a Daipe project skeleton covering our **best practices for Databricks projects**. Daipe is focused on the following paradigms:

* anyone with basic python skills can create pipelines and improve the business logic
* developing a standard DataLake project requires almost no engineers
* one code for all environments (your favorite IDE + Databricks UI)
* pursue consistency as the project grows
